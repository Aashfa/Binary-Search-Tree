# Binary-Search-Tree
### Project Title:
Binary Search Tree Traversal using Stack

### Description:
This project implements the traversal of a binary search tree (BST) using stacks. It includes three traversal methods: inorder, preorder, and postorder traversal.

### Files Included:
- `main.cpp`: Contains the implementation of BST traversal using stacks.
- `README.md`: This file.

### How to Run:
To run the program:
1. Compile the `main.cpp` file using a C++ compiler.
2. Execute the compiled program.

### Instructions:
Follow the on-screen prompts to perform BST insertion and view the different traversal methods.

### Topics Covered:
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Stack Data Structure
- Traversal Methods: Inorder, Preorder, Postorder

### Additional Notes:
- The program uses a BST data structure to store the elements.
- Traversal methods are implemented using stacks to achieve iterative traversal.
- Error handling is included for stack overflow and underflow conditions.
